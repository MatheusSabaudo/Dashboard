Program Description: Dashboard with Login and Registration using C# and Access Database

Overview:
This program will create a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using C#. It will include a login and registration system that connects to an Access Database to manage multiple user accounts.

Key Features:

1. User Registration:
Users can sign up for the dashboard by providing their personal information.
Registration form fields may include username, email address, password, and any additional profile information.
The program will validate user input and ensure data integrity.

2. User Login:
Registered users can log in with their credentials (username and password).
The program will authenticate users by verifying their login credentials against the data stored in the Access Database.

3. Access Database Integration:
The program establishes a connection to an Access Database to store and manage user account data.
It creates a table within the database to store user records, including fields for username, email, password (hashed for security), and any additional user data.

4. Dashboard Interface:
Upon successful login, users are directed to the dashboard interface.
The dashboard may display relevant information, charts, graphs, or data based on the application's purpose.
You can use Windows Forms for creating the dashboard's GUI.

5. Security Measures:
Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database to enhance security.
Input validation and sanitation are implemented to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

6. Multiple User Support:
The program allows multiple users to register and access their individual dashboards.
Each user's data is isolated and only accessible to the authenticated user.

7. User Account Management:
Registered users can change their account details, including updating their password or profile information.
Users may also have the option to reset their password if forgotten.

8. Logging and Error Handling:
Implement logging functionality to track user activities and errors for debugging purposes.

9. Session Management:
Use session management techniques to maintain user authentication throughout their dashboard session.

10. Technology Stack:
Programming Language: C#
GUI Framework: Windows Forms or WPF for creating the dashboard's graphical user interface.
Database: Microsoft Access Database for storing user account information.
Data Access: ADO.NET for database connectivity.
Security: Implement hashing and salting for password storage, and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Error Handling: Implement exception handling for robust error management.
Logging: Use a logging library like NLog or log4net for tracking user activities and errors.
